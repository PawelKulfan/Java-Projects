Hey, welcome to my Java projects and exercises 

I’ve started  learning Java language in november 2023 y. Here You will find 2 „bigger” programs, which I’ve created during my learning:

1.	Advanced Calculator:
      a.	Multi-operational (add, multiply, subtract, divide, pow, root),
  	b.	With memory of made operations, which can be reseted.

3.	Library Catalog:
      a.	Has set catalog of Books, which are characterized with Id, Title, Author Object, Array of Additional Authors and Popularity,
      b.	User can rent a book, which info will be stored in his rented books array,
      c.	Single or all Books can be returned, and each rental increases book popularity,
      d.	Script checks, if book is available for rental.


      Apart from them, You can find a lot of various Java exercises, which show my usage of methods, creating objects, handling exceptions etc. in Java Object Programing.
      Tech stack:
      Java 20
